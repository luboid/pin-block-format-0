# PinBlock in C#

Implementation of PinBlock Format 0 based on [ISO-9564](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9564) standard.
The PIN block is constructed by `XOR`-ing two 64-bit fields: the `plain text PIN field` and the `account number field`,
both of which comprise 16 four-bit `nibble`s.

The plain text PIN field is :

- one nibble with the value of 0, which identifies this as a format 0 block
- one nibble encoding the length `N` of the PIN
- `N` nibbles, each encoding one PIN digit
- 14−`N` nibbles, each holding the `Padding (cryptography)|fill` value 15 (i.e. 1111 or F)

The account number field is:

- four nibbles with the value of zero
- 12 nibbles containing the right-most 12 digits of the primary account number(PAN), excluding the `check digit`

## Extended PIN blocks

Formats 0 to 3 are all suitable for use with the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm, as they correspond to its 64-bit block size. However the standard allows for other encryption algorithms with larger block sizes, e.g. the Advanced Encryption Standard has a block size of 128 bits. In such cases the PIN must be encoding into an extended PIN block, the format of which is defined in a 2015 amendment to ISO 9564-1.
In this library, we have used **3DES** in **ECB/NoPadding** mode.
